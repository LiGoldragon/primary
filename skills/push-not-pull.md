# Skill — push, not pull

*Producers push state; consumers subscribe. Polling is wrong, always.*

## What this skill is for

When you have a producer of state and a consumer of changes, this
skill decides the protocol shape. The producer **pushes** updates
to the consumer; the consumer does **not poll** the producer.

If you find yourself reaching for a polling loop, stop. The
producer should expose a subscription primitive instead. If the
primitive doesn't exist yet, the dependent feature waits — it does
not paper over the gap.

## The rule

**Polling is wrong. Always.**

When a UI needs to reflect database state, the database tells the
UI what changed. When a daemon needs to react to client requests,
the client connects and sends; the daemon doesn't sweep a mailbox
directory. When an actor needs to know a child failed, the
supervisor receives a supervision event; it doesn't heartbeat-tick
its children to ask "still alive?"

If you find yourself reaching for a polling loop, stop. The
producer should expose a subscription primitive instead.

## Why

- **Polling burns latency.** A consumer polling at interval *N*
  has worst-case latency *N* between event and reaction. Pushed
  events arrive at the speed of the medium.
- **Polling burns work.** Most polls are no-ops; the work is
  wasted before the loop body runs.
- **Polling encodes the consumer's pacing into the producer's
  protocol.** The consumer says "I'll check every 1Hz" — but the
  right cadence is "whenever something happens." The push model
  says exactly that.
- **Polling fakes change-detection.** Two consecutive snapshots
  identical doesn't mean nothing happened — it means nothing
  *visible to the consumer's projection* happened, which is not
  the same thing.

## How

Producers expose a subscription primitive: register a callback,
open a stream, or accept a long-lived RPC. Consumers subscribe
once and receive events indefinitely.

In actor systems, each actor's mailbox is already a push channel;
nothing in the actor model requires polling. In databases with
change feeds, subscribe to the feed and react to deltas. In UIs
over a backing store, the store emits change events and the UI
rerenders.

If the producer can't yet push (the subscription primitive isn't
built), the consumer **defers its real-time feature** rather than
fall back to polling. A feature that depends on live updates
simply waits for the push primitive to ship; it does not paper
over the gap with a poll loop "for now." A poll "for now" never
gets removed.

## When polling is acceptable

There are no general exceptions. Two narrow shapes that look like
polling but aren't:

- **Reachability probes** with explicit transport-layer semantics
  — a monitoring agent that periodically checks "is service X
  reachable" is doing transport-layer reachability, not
  state-change detection. The contract is "are you alive," not
  "what changed."
- **Backpressure-aware pacing** where the consumer decides *when*
  it can accept the next push (rate-limiting itself). The producer
  still pushes; the consumer just drains its buffer at its own
  pace. This is a flow-control concern, not a polling one.

If you're not sure which case you're in, you're in the polling
case. Default to push.
