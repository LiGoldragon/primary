# Skill — report naming

*The basic naming and supersession discipline for reports. Every
agent needs this, regardless of whether they write substantive
reports themselves. Companion to `skills/reporting.md`, which
carries the larger discipline (chat-vs-report, inline-summary,
visuals, soft caps).*

## Filename

`reports/<role>/<N>-<primary-topic>[-<secondary-topic>]…-<title-slug>.md`

- `<role>` is the writer's exact lane subdirectory (`designer`,
  `operator`, `system-operator`, `poet`, assistant lanes, second
  lanes, and specialised lanes as configured).
- `<N>` is the next integer after the highest-numbered report in
  this role's subdirectory. **Per-role numbering**, not workspace-
  wide — `reports/operator/97-…md` and `reports/designer/97-…md`
  can coexist; the role subdir is the disambiguator.
- `<primary-topic>` is the durable topic cluster. Put it first so
  `rg --files reports | rg '/[0-9]+-schema-'` finds the current
  schema report surface without knowing the report's exact title.
- Optional `<secondary-topic>` facets follow the primary topic.
  Keep topic atoms short and stable: `nota`, `schema`, `macros`,
  `emission`, `spirit`, `wire`, `upgrade`, `runtime`,
  `reporting`, `orchestrate`.
- `<title-slug>` is the report's specific subject in kebab-case.
- **No leading zeros. No date prefix.** Commit history records
  when a report landed; the filename does not repeat that.

Report variant (`Psyche`, `Design`, `Audit`, `Research`,
`Synthesis`, `Closeout`, `Handover`) belongs in the YAML front
matter `variant:` field per `skills/reporting.md` §"Report header
— YAML front matter", AND in the filename per Spirit 1481
(Decision High): *"Report filename convention is
reports/<role>/<N>-<Variant>-<topic>-<date>.md where <Variant> is
a capitalized word naming the report kind. Every report has a
variant."* The variant appears in both surfaces — the filename for
filename-grep discoverability, the front matter for typed
machine-readable metadata. The older guidance that variant
belongs only in the header is retired.

Examples:

- `reports/operator/217-schema-canonical-current-state.md`
- `reports/operator/218-schema-macros-index-and-loading.md`
- `reports/designer/390-nota-shape-logic-floor.md`
- `reports/designer/391-reporting-agglomeration-policy.md`

To find the next number:

```sh
ls ~/primary/reports/<role>/ | grep -E '^[0-9]+-' \
  | sort -t- -k1,1n | tail -1
```

Then `N = (that number) + 1`. Numbers are not reused after deletion.

## Iteration with `-v2` / `-v3` suffix

When a report is being actively refined with feedback (back-and-
forth with the psyche or another agent), the edited version takes
a `-v2` / `-v3` suffix:

- v1 (implicit, no suffix): `225-workspace-redesign-direction.md`
- v2: `225-v2-workspace-redesign-direction.md`
- v3: `225-v3-workspace-redesign-direction.md`

The current version is the canonical one; delete the predecessor
in the same commit that lands the successor. Don't accumulate
v1/v2/v3 side-by-side.

## Supersession with a new number

When the topic shifts enough that the *name after the number*
should change (concept → implementation; redirect of scope;
absorption of an audit's findings), write a new numbered report
and delete the predecessor:

```
write   reports/<role>/226-new-topic.md    (absorbs /225)
delete  reports/<role>/225-old-topic.md    (same commit)
```

The new report carries forward anything still relevant from the
predecessor. The predecessor's number is retired — number
sequences are gap-tolerant; the next report takes
next-highest-plus-one within the role's subdir, not the freed
number.

## Topic agglomeration

When a topic accumulates many reports, do not bulk-rename old
files just to make the directory pretty. Write one current primary
topic report, carry forward the load-bearing substance, and retire
older reports only when their substance fully migrated.

Practical flow:

1. Pick one primary topic, for example `schema`.
2. Write `reports/<role>/<N>-schema-<title>.md`.
3. List the source reports read inside the new report.
4. Carry forward only current substance.
5. Classify sources as migrated, still-kept, or stale.
6. Delete stale predecessors only in the same committed change that
   lands the replacement.

Historical filenames remain valid locators in git history. New
reports use the topic-prefix convention forward.

## Commit before delete

**Never delete an uncommitted report.** Commit first. Deletion of
a committed report only removes it from the work tree — git
history retains the substance and the report is recoverable.
Deletion of an uncommitted report is total loss.

For the rename/supersession protocol: the new report must be
committed (in the same commit as, or before, the predecessor's
deletion). The discipline:

```
write    reports/<role>/N-new-topic.md
git add  reports/<role>/N-new-topic.md
git rm   reports/<role>/M-old-topic.md
commit                                       (one commit; both visible)
push
```

(With `jj`: a single `jj commit reports/...` finalises the addition
+ deletion together.)
