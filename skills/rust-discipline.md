# Skill — Rust discipline

*Behavior lives on types. Domain values are typed. Boundaries take
and return one object. Errors are enums you implement by hand.*

---

## What this skill is for

When you write or review Rust in this workspace, this skill is the
discipline. It is the Rust-specific enforcement of the cross-language
rules in this workspace's `skills/abstractions.md`,
`skills/naming.md`, `skills/beauty.md`, and `skills/micro-components.md`.

For toolchain reference (Cargo.toml shape, cross-crate dependencies,
git-URL deps + `cargoLock.outputHashes` pattern, pin strategy, Nix
packaging), see lore's `rust/style.md` and lore's
`rust/nix-packaging.md`. This skill is *how to write*; lore is *how
the toolchain works*.

---

## The rules in one sentence

**Behavior lives on types. Domain values are typed. Boundaries take
and return one object. Errors are enums you implement by hand.**

---

## Methods on types, not free functions

The only free function in a binary crate is `main`. Reusable
behavior is a method on a type or a trait impl. Test helpers are
methods on a fixture struct.

```rust
// Wrong
pub fn parse_cert(pem: &str) -> Result<Cert, Error> { … }

// Right
impl Cert {
    pub fn from_pem(pem: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> { … }
}
```

A small private helper inside one module is fine if it is
genuinely local (`fn hex(h: &Hash) -> String` next to a single
`Display` impl). Anything that smells reusable becomes a method.

For the cross-language version of this rule (the same idea
language-neutrally, plus the LLM-codegen reasoning and the
principled exceptions), see this workspace's
`skills/abstractions.md`. This section is the Rust enforcement.

**The deeper consequence**: free functions let the agent skip
creating the type that should own the behavior. If you're tempted
to write

```rust
// Wrong
pub fn parse_query(text: &str) -> Result<QueryOp, Error> { … }
```

the rule forces you to ask: *what type owns query parsing?* The
answer is `QueryParser`, and the rule's pressure makes that type
exist:

```rust
// Right
pub struct QueryParser<'input> { lexer: Lexer<'input> }

impl<'input> QueryParser<'input> {
    pub fn new(input: &'input str) -> Self { … }
    pub fn into_query(self) -> Result<QueryOp, Error> { … }
}
```

The rule of thumb: **every reusable verb belongs to a noun**. If
you can't name the noun, you haven't found the right model yet —
keep looking until you can.

---

## No ZST method holders

A `pub struct Foo;` whose `impl Foo` is just a parking lot for
functions that do real work on data they don't carry is a free
function in namespace clothing. The ZST is a label, nothing more —
the type doesn't track what the work operates on, only what it's
named after. This is the **methods-on-types** rule evaded one
level deeper: the verb got attached to *something*, but the
something is hollow.

When you see this, don't rename `Foo`. Don't accept the smell.
**Step back and find the noun.** A ZST-with-methods is the visible
scar of "I had a verb but couldn't find a noun, so I created a
fake noun to hold the verb." The right noun is a type that holds
the data the verb reads or writes — and it may not exist yet.
Invent it. Naming the right object is often the load-bearing
design decision the prior thinking missed.

```rust
// Wrong — ZST as a folder for free functions
pub struct CertParser;

impl CertParser {
    pub fn parse_pem(pem: &str) -> Result<Cert, Error> { … }
    pub fn parse_der(der: &[u8]) -> Result<Cert, Error> { … }
    pub fn fingerprint(cert: &Cert) -> Hash { … }
}

// Right — the verbs belong on the noun whose data they touch
impl Cert {
    pub fn from_pem(pem: &str) -> Result<Self, Error> { … }
    pub fn from_der(der: &[u8]) -> Result<Self, Error> { … }
    pub fn fingerprint(&self) -> Hash { … }
}
```

If parsing genuinely needs its own state (a buffered lexer,
accumulated diagnostics, a configurable mode), then the noun is
`CertParser` *with fields* — see the `QueryParser` example above.
Either the work belongs on the data type, or it belongs on a
stateful parser type. The ZST middle ground is the gap.

### Legitimate ZST uses — narrow, named

ZSTs earn their keep when they carry **type-level information**
rather than pretending to carry runtime state:

- **`PhantomData<T>`** and other generic-parameter trackers.
- **Marker types required by external frameworks** — `ractor`
  actor behaviour markers, sealed-trait gates, an `Iterator` impl
  on a unit struct that genuinely has no carried state. The ZST
  has *only* trait-impl methods that delegate to a data-bearing
  partner type; never inherent methods doing real work.
- **Type-level enum variants** in trait-encoded state machines,
  where the unit struct *is* the state and the type system
  enforces transitions.

The test: does the ZST's job vanish if you erase its name from
the type system? If yes (it was just a namespace), the verbs need
a real noun. If no (the type-system position is what does the work
— phantom parameter, marker, state), the ZST is fine.

## Domain values are types, not primitives

If a value has identity beyond its bits, it gets a newtype. A
content hash is not a `String`. A node name is not a `String`. A
file path used as an identifier is not a `Path`.

```rust
// Wrong
pub fn details(&self, md5: &str) -> Result<Item, Error> { … }

// Right
pub struct Md5([u8; 16]);
pub fn details(&self, md5: &Md5) -> Result<Item, Error> { … }
```

**The wrapped field is private.** A `pub` field exposes the
primitive and defeats every reason to wrap it: callers can
construct unchecked values and read the raw bytes back out.

```rust
// Wrong — pub field, the type is just a label
pub struct NodeName(pub String);

// Right — field private; construction and access go through methods
pub struct NodeName(String);

impl NodeName {
    pub fn new(s: impl Into<String>) -> Self { Self(s.into()) }   // or TryFrom if validated
}

impl AsRef<str> for NodeName {
    fn as_ref(&self) -> &str { &self.0 }
}
```

Construction with validation goes through `TryFrom<&str>` (or
`from_str`) returning the crate's `Error`.

---

## One type per concept — no `-Details` / `-Info` companions

If you find yourself defining `Item` *and* `ItemDetails`, stop.
The `-Details` or `-Info` suffix paired with a base type is one
concept fragmented across two types because the base was designed
too thin. Fix the base type. The same applies to `-Extra`,
`-Meta`, `-Full`, `-Extended`, `-Raw`/`-Parsed` pairs, and any
other suffix that means "the real version of the thing next door."

```rust
// Wrong — two types for one concept
struct Item { md5: Md5, name: String }
struct ItemDetails { md5: Md5, name: String, size: u64, mirrors: Vec<Url>, … }

// Right — one Item, complete
struct Item {
    md5: Md5,
    name: String,
    size: u64,
    mirrors: Vec<Url>,
    …
}
```

If different *call sites* genuinely need different *projections*,
model that with a method that returns a smaller view
(`item.summary()`), not with a parallel type.

---

## One object in, one object out

Method signatures take at most one explicit object argument and
return exactly one object. When inputs or outputs need more,
define a struct.

**Anonymous tuples are not used at type boundaries** — not as
return types, not as parameter types, not as struct fields, not in
type aliases. The exception is **tuple newtypes**: `struct
Md5([u8; 16])`, `struct NodeName(String)`. They use tuple syntax
to wrap a single thing, but the wrapper itself is a named type.
Local destructuring like `let (a, b) = pair;` against a
tuple-newtype's inner is fine; the rule is about type-level
appearances of unnamed tuples.

The verb is the method name; the noun is the type. Don't smuggle
the verb into the type name (`DownloadRequest` + `download_url(req)`)
— make it a method on the input (`Request::download`).

```rust
// Wrong — multi-primitive args at the boundary
fn download_url(&self, md5: &str, path_index: Option<u32>,
                domain_index: Option<u32>) -> Result<Download, Error> { … }

// Wrong — free function with tuple return
fn parse_results(html: &str) -> Result<(Vec<SearchResult>, bool), Error> { … }

// Right — input is a Request; the verb is a method on it
struct Request { md5: Md5, path_index: Option<u32>, domain_index: Option<u32> }

impl Request {
    pub fn download(&self) -> Result<Download, Error> { … }
}

// Right — input is a SearchPage; parse is a method on it
struct SearchPage { html: String, page: u32 }

impl SearchPage {
    pub fn parse(&self) -> Result<SearchResponse, Error> { … }
}

// Right — one explicit object alongside self (relational operation)
impl Tree {
    pub fn merge(&self, other: Tree) -> Result<Tree, Error> { … }
}
```

`self` is implicit; the rule counts explicit arguments only. A
method takes zero or one typed object alongside `self`.

---

## Constructors are associated functions

`new`, `with_*`, `from_*`, `build` — never module-level free
functions.

| Name           | Use when                                                       |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `new`          | default / minimal construction.                                |
| `with_<thing>` | ergonomic alt with one extra knob (`Tree::with_bits`).         |
| `from_<src>`   | conversion from a specific source type or representation.      |
| `from_input`   | conversion from a typed input struct (single-object-in style). |
| `build`        | multi-step construction with clearly-named primitive args.     |
| `Default`      | when "empty / zero" is meaningful for the type.                |
| `From<T>`      | infallible conversion from another type.                       |
| `TryFrom<T>`   | fallible conversion. Pair with `Error` enum.                   |

Prefer `TryFrom` when the conversion has one canonical source
type; prefer `from_<src>(…) -> Result<Self, Error>` when there are
several plausible sources or extra args.

---

## Use existing trait domains

If `core::str::FromStr` already names what you do, implement
`FromStr`, not an inherent `parse` method. Same for `Display`,
`From`, `TryFrom`, `AsRef`, `Default`, `Iterator`. Don't reach for
an inherent method just because it's quicker.

```rust
use core::str::FromStr;

impl FromStr for Message {
    type Err = MessageParseError;
    fn from_str(input: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> { … }
}
```

Inherent methods that bypass an obvious trait domain are a smell.

---

## Direction-encoded names

Prefer `from_*`, `to_*`, `into_*`, `as_*`. Avoid `read`, `write`,
`load`, `save` when a direction word already conveys the meaning.
`as_str` over `get_string`. `to_hex` over `format_hex`.
`from_bytes` over `parse_bytes`.

`get` / `put` are fine for storage interfaces (`ChunkStore::get`);
they name the storage operation, not a conversion.

---

## Naming — full English words

Spell every identifier as full English words; the cryptic
in-group dialect is fossil from 6-char FORTRAN, 80-column cards,
and 10-cps teletypes. Cross-language version with the offender
table and the six permitted exception classes lives in this
workspace's `skills/naming.md`.

```rust
// Wrong — cryptic in-group dialect
fn parse(input: &str) -> Result<Token, Error> {
    let mut lex = Lexer::new(input);
    let tok = lex.next_tok()?;
    let kd = tok.kind();
    let ctx = ParseCtx::new(&kd);
    let de = Deser::with_ctx(ctx);
    de.deser_op(&tok)
}

// Right — every name reads as English
fn parse(input: &str) -> Result<Token, Error> {
    let mut lexer = Lexer::new(input);
    let token = lexer.next_token()?;
    let kind = token.kind();
    let context = ParseContext::new(&kind);
    let deserializer = Deserializer::with_context(context);
    deserializer.deserialize_operation(&token)
}
```

`self` is the implicit receiver and is universal across Rust —
leave it. This rule is about *naming the things you create*, not
renaming the language's primitives.

---

## Errors: typed enum per crate via thiserror

Each crate defines its own `Error` enum in `src/error.rs`,
derived with `thiserror`. Variants are structured — carry the data
needed to render a useful message. Foreign error types convert
via `#[from]`.

```rust
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Error)]
pub enum Error {
    #[error("chunk not found: {0}")]
    ChunkNotFound(Hash),

    #[error("deserialization failed: {0}")]
    DeserializationFailed(String),

    #[error("invalid node: {0}")]
    InvalidNode(String),

    #[error("merge conflict on key ({} bytes)", key.len())]
    MergeConflict { key: Vec<u8> },

    #[error("network: {0}")]
    Network(#[from] reqwest::Error),
}
```

Public APIs return `Result<T, Error>` with the crate's own enum.
**Never** `anyhow::Result`, `eyre::Result`, or `Result<T, Box<dyn
Error>>` — they erase the error type at the boundary, which loses
the typed-failure discipline the rest of the rules build up.
Callers can no longer pattern-match on what went wrong.

---

## Actors: logical units with ractor

When the daemon grows enough concurrent state to need an actor
framework, the reason is **logical cohesion, coherence, and
consistency** — not performance. An actor is the unit you reach
for when you want to model a coherent component: it owns its
state, exposes a typed message protocol, and has a defined
lifecycle. The framework is `ractor`.

- **Messages are typed.** Each actor's message type is its own
  enum, one variant per request kind. No untyped channels.
- **State is owned, not shared.** The actor's state lives inside
  the actor and is mutated only by its message handlers.
  `Arc<Mutex<T>>` shared between actors is a smell — send a
  message to whoever owns the state.
- **Supervision is recursive.** An actor that spawns sub-actors
  supervises them. Failures escalate; the parent decides restart
  vs shutdown. No detached tasks.
- **Use actors for components, not for chores.** A function that
  awaits an HTTP call is a method, not an actor. An actor exists
  because the *concept* it models warrants its own state and
  protocol.

**Ractor is the default** for any component with state and a
message protocol. The per-actor overhead is negligible on modern
hardware, and the discipline (typed messages, owned state,
supervision trees) pays back immediately — you never end up
retrofitting concurrency later. Ractor pulls tokio in; that's
acceptable everywhere — for daemons and structured services,
tokio via ractor is just the runtime.

For the *how* — the per-file four-piece template,
perfect-specificity messages, supervision, self-cast loops, and
the sync-façade pattern — see lore's `rust/ractor.md`.

Plain sync code is fine for one-shot CLIs, build tools, and
library crates with no concurrent state.

---

## One Rust crate per repo

Rust crates live in their own dedicated repos and are consumed
via flake inputs. Don't inline a Rust crate inside a non-Rust
repo (e.g. under a NixOS-platform repo's `packages/`). A Rust
crate has its own toolchain pin, its own Cargo lockfile, its own
test surface, its own release cadence, and its own style
obligations. Inlining one inside a heterogeneous repo couples
those concerns to the host repo's churn for no gain. Consume via
flake input instead.

A workspace of related Rust crates (e.g. lib + cli) belongs in
**one** repo together. The split is per *project*, not per crate.

For the toolchain reference (Cargo.toml conventions, cross-crate
dependencies, git-URL deps, pin strategy), see lore's
`rust/style.md`.

---

## Tests live in separate files

Unit tests do **not** go in a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block at
the bottom of the source file. They live in a sibling file under
`tests/` at the crate root, named for the module they exercise.

```
src/
├── cert.rs
├── tree.rs
└── error.rs
tests/
├── cert.rs      # integration tests for Cert
└── tree.rs      # integration tests for Tree
```

This keeps the source file focused on behavior, lets the test
file grow without bloating the source file, and forces tests to
exercise the public API (integration tests can't reach private
items — which is the right pressure: if something is hard to test
from outside, the API needs work, not the test). Private-helper
tests are rare and can go in a small `tests_internal` module with
a clear boundary; if you find yourself reaching for many, that's
a signal the helper wants to be its own type with a public
constructor.

One test file per source file. Don't collect tests from multiple
modules into a single `tests/common.rs` unless the shared
fixtures genuinely apply to more than one module.

---

## Module layout

One concern per file. Typical crate:

```
src/
├── lib.rs        # re-exports + crate-level doc (//!)
├── error.rs      # Error enum + impls
├── types.rs      # domain newtypes + small structs
├── <thing>.rs    # one file per major type / subsystem
└── main.rs       # only if the crate is a binary; only free fn lives here
```

Impls live in the same file as the type they're for. Don't split
types and impls across files.

### Split traits into their own files when they accumulate

When a single file grows past ~300 lines because traits have
piled up on a type, split each trait impl into its own file. The
file for a type holds the type definition + its inherent impls;
each separate file holds one trait impl for that type, named for
the trait.

```
src/cert/
├── mod.rs              # type definition + inherent impls (Cert::new, fields)
├── from_str.rs         # impl FromStr for Cert
├── display.rs          # impl Display for Cert
├── try_from_pem.rs     # impl TryFrom<Pem> for Cert
└── serde_impls.rs      # impl Serialize + Deserialize for Cert (paired traits)
```

This is the deliberate trade-off **explicit code is fine; long
files are not**. Splitting trait impls into separate files keeps
any single file readable, makes the type's surface discoverable
from the directory listing, and prevents impl blocks from growing
into a wall of unrelated behavior.

Use this pattern when traits accumulate. Don't pre-split a type
with two trait impls — that's premature ceremony. Split when a
file is becoming hard to navigate.

---

## Documentation

Doc comments are impersonal, timeless, precise. Document the
contract; don't restate the signature.

```rust
impl Cert {
    /// Issue a server certificate against this CA.
    ///
    /// The CA's signing key must be an Ed25519 key resolvable via the
    /// local GPG agent. The server keypair is ECDSA P-256, generated fresh.
    pub fn issue_server(&self, request: ServerCertRequest) -> Result<Self, Error> { … }
}
```

Module-level docs go in `//!` at the top of `lib.rs` or `///` at
the top of a single-purpose module file. Skip docs on obvious
boilerplate: getters, `From` impls, internal helpers.

No examples in doc comments unless the API is non-obvious. No
personal voice. No future tense. Present indicative only.
