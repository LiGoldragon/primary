# rust-component-architecture

How we design our components.

## The component

Every component is a daemon speaking Signal. Around the daemon:

- `<component>` — the repo holding the daemon and its logic. The
  daemon binary is `<component>-daemon`.
- `signal-<component>` — the wire type repo: the typed vocabulary of
  the component's public wire surface.
- `meta-signal-<component>` — the owner's wire type repo: policy and
  configuration vocabulary. Never optional — configuration flows
  through it.
- `core-<component>` — optional library when the logic must also be
  consumed as a library. A dependency of the daemon, never the other
  way around.
- The CLI binary `<component>` and the meta CLI `<component>-meta`.

## The daemon

Everything is in the daemon. It loads its domain and holds the whole
thing — every object as its own specifically typed object, a specific
type for every kind. It thinks in typed values, never in text: no
text arrives on its wire and none leaves it.

Each daemon owns its own sema database — its typed durable store,
reached only through the sema-engine library, in a `.sema` file. There
is no central storage daemon. Policy state and working state live in
that one store; policy changes only through meta-socket mutation.

A daemon starts from a single argument: a signal-encoded Configure
message. A virgin daemon applies it as first configuration; a daemon
with a populated store resumes from its store. The same Configure type
is accepted live over the meta socket. With no configuration, the
daemon waits in an unconfigured semi-started state — it never guesses.

A daemon may be a Signal client of any number of peer daemons.

## Signal — the wire format

Signal is the messaging layer. A message is an rkyv binary archive —
typed, portable, validated on receive. Frames are length-prefixed on
the socket. Nothing else rides the wire: no JSON, no text, no second
protocol.

Every daemon opens two sockets: the ordinary socket, for any
authenticated peer, and the meta socket, for its owner. Every surface
answers with typed replies, including a typed refusal — errors are
vocabulary, not strings.

The signal wire vocabulary is versioned by its contract crate: the
crate's semver is the wire's semver, and consumers pin it.

## The CLIs

The CLI's role is to transform text into Signal. It is the boundary
where the textual form ends and the binary world begins.

A CLI speaks to exactly one daemon — its own. It opens no database,
reaches no other component, and carries no logic worth keeping: it is
eventually obsolete machinery, kept thin. `<component>` fronts the
ordinary socket; `<component>-meta` fronts the meta socket.

Every component process takes exactly one argument and no flags. The
CLI accepts text or a signal-encoded file; the daemon accepts only the
signal-encoded form.

## The wire type repos

A wire type repo declares vocabulary and nothing else: no runtime, no
actors, no async machinery. It owns the frame envelope and its
encode/decode, the protocol version, a closed enum of request kinds
with their paired replies, and the typed payload of every operation.
No catch-all variants — the vocabulary is closed.

Operations are verbs in verb form: `Submit`, not `Submission`.
Replies are the verb's past tense; rejections name themselves.
Storage classification vocabulary never appears on the public wire —
what a peer may ask is domain language, not database language.

Every record kind lands as a concrete text example with a round-trip
test before its type is final: the example is the falsifiable
specification.

## Traits first

Design begins with traits. Every concept deserves at least one trait,
and probably more; the trait pass comes before any body is written,
and defaults are given wherever a default is expressible.

Identity is trait-borne: an encoded form fingerprints itself — by
default, the hash of its rkyv archive — and every reference names its
target by that encoded name, never by spelling. The true name of a
thing is what it is, not what it is called; textual names are surface
for humans and never enter a body.

Traits live on data-bearing types. A zero-sized type with behavior is
a namespace pretending to be a thing — the verbs belong to a real
noun.

## How components fit together

Peers depend on each other's wire type repos, never on each other's
daemons. The contract is the whole relationship.

Observation flows up, authority flows down: state is observed through
push subscriptions — a typed snapshot on open, typed deltas after —
and commanded through the owner's mutation vocabulary. Polling is
forbidden; a correct system goes quiet when nothing changes.

When one intent spans several components, the issuer commits on the
first success and records divergence on failure — no distributed
rollback, no all-or-nothing stall.

One capability, one component. A component is sized to be held whole
in one mind — human or model; when it outgrows that, it splits.
