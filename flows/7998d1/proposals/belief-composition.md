# The Belief Nexus

The Belief Nexus holds the belief modules and furnishes workspaces with them. Belief is the word: what a model believes when it starts. It replaces Curriculum. Its memory is its own; a definition in the Flow Nexus refers to a module by name only, and a name may resolve to nothing: the Belief Nexus answers which names are missing, and what is done about it is the definition's policy, never the Nexus's.

## Signal
The owner registers a belief repository at the Belief Nexus's own CLI, by his login, as he defines a complex at the Flow Nexus. A peer the meta peer list names furnishes over any registered repository.

#### Proposal 1: A composition names the placement · psyche-belief › vision/belief-nexus-v1.md

- A registered repository is watched: when its main moves, every workspace furnished with a module it changed is furnished again, and the Flow Nexus is told which flows now run on old belief, so a perma flow can be refreshed on it. A module is named by kind and subject; its front matter names its placement, system prompt or skill. The skills directory is the harness's.

- A module's front matter names its placement; the default per Kind is a meta setting, set one value at a time, never in the Rust. The meta peer list names the peers admitted to Furnish, each bound by kernel credentials as a Nexus's peers are.

+ ## Composition
+
+ Everything about belief is configuration. Modules come from several sources at once, each configured in the Belief Nexus: a repository, the pure reference, or a local path, the quick one, for developing and debugging.
+
+ A composition is a saved configuration of belief: the modules, and for each its placement: the system prompt, the startup prompt, a skill the flow sees, a skill it is not shown, or held in the Belief Nexus alone. Every belief is reached through the Belief Nexus. A composition is kept in the Belief Nexus under its name, and a definition in the Flow Nexus refers to it by that name.
+
+ A subagent is composed as a flow is, from the same modules, by a composition. The effect differs: the composition is written as one subagent file, for the flow it is intended for.
+
+ Each module's content is inserted between delimiters that name it, where it starts and where it ends, so a flow or a subagent knows where each of its beliefs comes from, and which one probably influenced an action.
+
```datom
+ Compose.{ reviewer
+           [ { { Spirit core } SystemPrompt }
+             { { Intent design } SystemPrompt }
+             { { Vision ethos } StartupPrompt }
+             { { Knowledge search } VisibleSkill } ] }

## Emission

Furnishing is writing: each module into the workspace's system-prompt bundle or the harness's skills directory, as its placement says.

```ethos
Emission
[ belief:[ Workspace ModuleName Location ]
  flow:[ Harness ] ]                   ; imports: the harness names the skills directory
[ Write.{ Workspace Harness Vector<ModuleName> } ] ; emissions: the bundle and the skills, written
[ Written.Location ]                   ; outcomes
[]
```

## Memory

```ethos
Memory
[ belief:[ ModuleSource ModuleName ] ]
[ Source.{ ModuleSource Vector<ModuleName> } ; records: each registered source and the modules it holds
  Answer.[ Succeeded Failed ] ]
```

```datom
Furnish.{ /home/li/primary Claude
          [ { Spirit core } { Vision nexus-v1 }
            { Vision none } ] }
Furnished.{ { /home/li/primary/.bundle
              /home/li/primary/.claude/skills }
            [ { Vision none } ] }
```

## The ordinary single-reply boundary

The ordinary translator prepares a request once. Register, Resolve and Furnish enter a checked single-reply capability. Subscribe keeps its existing streaming path. The meta service keeps its existing path, including configuration application and recovery.

Preparation retains the direct request codec's structured error. A valid single-reply request enters execution with its caller connection. Execution returns Answered after the domain reply frame has been written successfully, or NexusDown when connecting to the Nexus fails before forwarding. These are in-process observations. The caller's successful domain datom keeps its existing form.

The composed service's Unreadable observation belongs to request preparation. Checked execution has no unreadable-request branch.

    o -->|"write succeeds"| a["Answered"]
    o -->|"write fails"| e["owned observed response + native write error"]
```

### Conceptual observations and the executable capability

The Belief ordinary single-reply service realizes the conceptual connection-level observations through one preparation boundary followed by checked execution. Its executable capability takes a checked request and connection, rather than the conceptual example's bare Connection; it returns a fallible SingleReplyOutcome rather than the composed Outcome. Preparation contributes Unreadable; checked execution contributes Answered or NexusDown.

`Unreadable.Error` corresponds exactly to the direct `datom_codec::Error`. The decoder preserves that value rather than converting it to a diagnostic string. This executable contract belongs to the Belief Nexus; the general example in vision:nexus-v1 remains conceptual.

### Authored Rust — in-process types

This is author-written Rust, not generated Rust. Ethos lowering for these generic/native-error shapes is unverified; no new Ethos spelling is asserted.

The native leaves retain their dependency-owned types: `datom_codec::Error`, `signal::FrameError`, `rkyv::rancor::Error`, `std::io::Error`, `std::string::FromUtf8Error`, and the existing local `TranslatorError`. These values remain in process; this contract adds no serialization requirement to them.

```rust
use std::io;
use std::os::unix::net::UnixStream;
use std::string::FromUtf8Error;
use signal::FrameError;
use signal_belief_nexus as public;

// Existing local diagnostic type, retained rather than redesigned.
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum TranslatorError {
    Text(String),
    Signal(String),
    Peer(String),
    Configuration(String),
    Io(io::Error),
}

// Observations of preparation composed with single-reply execution.
pub enum Outcome {
    Answered,
    Unreadable(datom_codec::Error),
    NexusDown,
}

// A decoded, checked request can produce only these successful observations.
pub enum SingleReplyOutcome {
    Answered,
    NexusDown,
}

impl From<SingleReplyOutcome> for Outcome {
    fn from(value: SingleReplyOutcome) -> Self {
        match value {
            SingleReplyOutcome::Answered => Self::Answered,
            SingleReplyOutcome::NexusDown => Self::NexusDown,
        }
    }
}

pub enum PreparationFailure {
    RequestFrame(FrameError),
    RequestText(FromUtf8Error),
    Precondition(TranslatorError),
}

pub enum BeforeForwardFailure {
    Precondition(TranslatorError),
    Archive(rkyv::rancor::Error),
    NexusSetup(io::Error),
}

pub enum ReplyFailure {
    Frame(FrameError),
    Decode(rkyv::rancor::Error),
}

pub struct ResponseWriteFailure<Response> {
    pub response: Response,
    pub error: FrameError,
}

pub enum SingleReplyFailure<Response> {
    BeforeForward(BeforeForwardFailure),
    Forwarding(FrameError),
    Awaiting(ReplyFailure),
    ResponseWriteFailure(ResponseWriteFailure<Response>),
}
```

PreparationFailure records a failure before a checked query exists. Its Precondition retains existing preparation configuration errors. BeforeForward records that this checked call's request has not been forwarded to the Nexus. It makes no claim that the process performed no local work: preparation, peer/configuration checks, archiving and socket setup remain their own acts. NexusSetup is configuration of an already-connected socket; a failed Nexus connection produces NexusDown instead.

Forwarding records a failed request write, which may have been partial. Awaiting records a failed response read or typed restoration after forwarding, when the requested effect may already have occurred. ResponseWriteFailure moves the observed typed domain response into the failure together with the native caller-write error. That response records the Nexus's answer; it does not assert caller delivery or retry safety.

A frame error or invalid UTF-8 is transport evidence, distinct from a malformed Datom. The request-codec error is carried intact. Native archive/restoration errors remain native errors.

### Authored Rust — preparation and routing

`SingleReplyQuery` owns the original domain query. Its private field is constructed only by the exhaustive route match below; Subscribe has its own route. The four existing ordinary query variants are Register, Resolve, Furnish and Subscribe.

```rust
pub struct SingleReplyQuery {
    query: public::Query,
}

pub enum PreparedOrdinary {
    SingleReply(SingleReplyQuery),
    Subscribe,
    Unreadable(datom_codec::Error),
}

impl From<public::Query> for PreparedOrdinary {
    fn from(query: public::Query) -> Self {
        match query {
            query @ public::Query::Register(_)
            | query @ public::Query::Resolve(_)
            | query @ public::Query::Furnish(_) =>
                Self::SingleReply(SingleReplyQuery { query }),
            public::Query::Subscribe => Self::Subscribe,
        }
    }
}


pub trait OrdinaryPreparing {
    fn prepare(
        &self,
        connection: &mut UnixStream,
    ) -> Result<PreparedOrdinary, PreparationFailure>;
}

pub trait SingleReplyServing {
    type Response;

    fn serve(
        &self,
        request: SingleReplyQuery,
        connection: &mut UnixStream,
    ) -> Result<SingleReplyOutcome, SingleReplyFailure<Self::Response>>;
}
```

The ordinary decoder/router site becomes the typed preparation boundary. Its decoder preserves the direct codec error instead of converting it into the existing Text diagnostic; the request is still decoded once. The unreadable branch supplies `Outcome::Unreadable(error)` by moving the exact error. Its unary branch invokes SingleReplyServing and maps the returned SingleReplyOutcome into Outcome. A preparation failure remains PreparationFailure evidence. RequestFrame and RequestText are preparation-only cases; checked unary execution has neither variant. Its Subscribe branch invokes the existing stream path with its existing return semantics. These are separate branches, not a common session-completion wrapper.

The unary capability owns peer/precondition checks, call archiving, Nexus contact and setup, request forwarding, response restoration and caller response writing. The response type stays associated with the capability; ResponseWriteFailure stores that same type. Domain refusals are domain responses, so successfully writing one produces Answered.

The existing meta path is outside this capability. Its post-response apply/restore sequence and nested Nexus call retain their own design boundary.

### Existing native evidence shapes

The direct request codec's error structure is retained whole. These are dependency declarations shown for correspondence, not newly authored replacements.

```rust
// datom_codec
pub type Integer = i64;
pub type Path = Vec<Integer>;
pub enum ErrorLayer { Protos, Datom, Composition }
pub struct Error {
    pub layer: ErrorLayer,
    pub path: Path,
    pub kind: ErrorKind,
}
pub enum ErrorKind {
    Budget,
    Structural(protos::Error),
    Form { expected: String, found: String },
    Arity { expected: Integer, found: Integer },
    Value { expected: String, value: String },
    Variant { expected: String, found: String },
}
```

```rust
// protos
pub struct Extent { pub start: usize, pub end: usize }
pub struct Error { pub extent: Extent, pub problem: Problem }
pub enum Problem {
    Empty, Multiple, Unclosed(char), Unexpected(char),
    MissingHead, MissingBody, Budget, Depth,
}
```

```rust
// signal
pub enum FrameError {
    Io(std::io::Error),
    BodyTooLarge { found: usize, capacity: usize },
}
```

The standard-library I/O and UTF-8 errors and the rkyv native error remain opaque dependency-owned evidence. This module specifies their placement and ownership, not their private representation.

### Existing ordinary domain contract

The domain vocabulary is retained. This is its existing Ethos, including the declarations needed by Query and Response. The service types above use the compiled ordinary contract as `public`.
