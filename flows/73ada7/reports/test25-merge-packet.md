# Test 25 merge packet

Merge candidate 13378c4472dc9361c3898326e1d6e52ecc90a9f6 (Flow stand-in, parent 9409cb71850cb08d1ab80e2e08c0232f0ff6e7e0) onto message-test 4d40751aaafb71eaa9d498ac5d66c7ab13c7318a. Both commits were read from a fresh scratch clone of github LiGoldragon/message-test (both are on GitHub). No repository was changed; nothing committed or pushed.

Witnessed: 9409cb7 is an ancestor of 4d40751, so it is the merge base. A trial `git merge-tree` of the two commits in the scratch clone merged without conflict (tree 68d01ac7cecf5564a19b637b7f1472da3b247f73). The candidate adds 7 files and touches only flake.nix and lib/default.nix of the three named; it does not touch README.md or flake.lock. No line truly conflicts.

```
Its 10-file change since the merge base 9409cb7 (witnessed, git diff --stat): README.md, checks/message-flow-reaped.nix (new, test 24), four fixtures/message-flow/flow/model-*.datom, flake.nix, lib/components/flow.nix, lib/message-flow.nix, packages/message-flow-claude.nix. The head commit itself changes only lib/message-flow.nix (the duplicate environment key). lib/default.nix is unchanged on that side.

# message-test

Acceptance scenarios for the Message Nexus run together with the real Flow
Nexus. This repository holds no component source: `message` and `flow` are
flake inputs whose `nixpkgs` follows this flake's.

The scenarios are written to two designs in the Primary repository
(github:LiGoldragon/primary):

- Message: `flows/73ada7/reports/build/message-design.md` at be5c2e5b
  (blob e3ea9872), sections 3 to 9; tests are numbered as its section 9
  numbers them.
- Flow: `flows/f5a6e9/reports/flow-buildable-design.md` at 9b006dd2
  (blob c443d8a8), sections 1 and 2.

From them: an Address written short, `{ Mind nexus Secondary }`; the send
`Send.{ Recipient Request }`, Recipient being Flow's
`Recipient.[ Address Up ]`, written as the Message design writes it,
`Send.{ { Mind nexus Secondary } Order.«…» }` or `Send.{ Up Result.«…» }`.
On Flow: Message's lock request `Lock.{ Sender Recipient }`, answered
`Locked.Lock` with the Lock `{ Sender Address Until }`; Flow resolves `Up`
relative to the sender and refuses `OffRoute` and `NoneAbove` at the lock
request; `Deliver.{ Lock Request }` and `Release.Lock` carry that Lock.
Message binds to Flow as `{ Field message Primary }`, and Flow admits Lock,
Deliver and Release only from that exact Message process, so no scenario
calls them directly; this repository keeps only what is observable through
Message. Flow's own lock contract (an unknown lock, Release after Deliver and
after lapse, a lapsed Until, End refused while a lock is held, the lease) is
covered by flow-test, and so is the Message design's test 26, a send from an
asleep sender, refused Asleep.
Message binds at its start with
`Bind.{ { Field message Primary } { Pid Started } }`. Test 21 makes the old
store with old Message, the `message-old` input pinned at 6fa4d0. Flow starts with `Start.{ OrdinarySocketPath MetaSocketPath }`.
A datom String is written bare when it has no space, no delimiter glyph and
does not begin or end with `.`, `!` or `:`; otherwise in guillemets. `Bind.{ Address
Process }` on Flow's ordinary socket, Process `{ Pid Started }`, answered
`Bound.FlowId`;
`Stop.FlowId` leaves the metaflow Asleep; `End.Address`, `Current.Address`
and `Metaflows`. Flow's unknown refusals are one
`Unknown.[ Address Lock FlowId Key ]`; no design writes their print, so they
are matched by their head. Flow's sockets come from its start command.

Flow accepts Message's start Bind only from the executable that
`Configure.Nexus`'s MessageNexusBinary names, and refuses it NotConfigured
before any `Configure.Nexus`. So the frame starts Flow at boot, gives it the
model of each layer and a `Configure.Nexus`, and only then starts Message. In
that payload MessageNexusBinary is the message-nexus under test, a real file
(Flow compares canonical paths, and the frame checks it resolves to a file), and
MessageNexusPath the VM's Message ordinary socket; SourceRoot, StableCodex,
NextCodex, HarnessProfiles and MetaAspects are VM-local fixture values that
no pure scenario exercises, since none launches a flow, and Lease is 60.
Nothing in it comes from the living's setup.

Where the Message design leaves a fork to the living (its section 12), each
scenario is written against the fork's first option and names that fork
in its header and in the `forks` it prints.

Both Nexuses start with no arguments, and each client reaches its Nexus at
the defaults they share; the frame names no socket before a payload does.
Message's meta client persists `fixtures/message-flow/message.datom`
(answered `Configured`, or `RestartRequired` when a socket changed), Message
is restarted with no arguments on its store, and the frame waits until a
process listens on each socket the payload names.

Test unpushed code with `--override-input message path:<checkout>` or
`--override-input flow path:<checkout>`; once it lands, `nix flake update
<input>` and commit the lock.

## Layout

    lib/components/herdr.nix        headless Herdr
    lib/message-flow.nix            the frame of a pure scenario: one VM, three user services
    lib/message-flow.py             the frame's helpers: configure, panes, Bind, send, trace
    checks/herdr.nix                the rig: headless Herdr in the VM
    checks/message-flow-*.nix       tests 1-21 and 24-30, one per file;
                                    11, 25, 30 pending; 26 in flow-test
    packages/message-flow-claude.nix tests 22 and 23, semi-sandbox
    fixtures/message-flow/          the meta Configure payloads
    lib/skill-variable.nix          the runner's skill-variable reader
    checks/skill-variable.nix       the reader over a sample file
    checks/lint.nix, formatter.nix  style gate

## Scenarios

| # | check | forks | drive | expect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | message-flow-delivered | F2 F4 F6* F8 F9 F10 | Order to awake { Mind nexus Secondary } | Delivered; trace Identified, Locked, Delivered; pane shows sender and request |
| 2 | message-flow-queued | F1 F6* F8 | Notice to a metaflow asleep after Stop | Queued; Current.Asleep; Metaflows shows the Notice queued once |
| 3 | message-flow-unknown | F6* F8 | send to no such metaflow | Refused.Unknown.… |
| 4 | message-flow-ended | F6* F8 | send to Ended metaflow | Refused.Ended.… |
| 5 | message-flow-off-route | F2 F6* F8 | Field Tertiary to Psyche Primary | Refused.OffRoute from the lock; no Deliver or Release traced |
| 6 | message-flow-same-layer | F4 F6* F8 F10 | Field Secondary to Mind Secondary | Delivered |
| 7 | message-flow-above | F4 F6* F8 F10 | Mind Secondary to { Mind nexus Primary } | Delivered to Mind Primary |
| 8 | message-flow-up | F4 F6* F7* F8 F10 | Up from Mind Secondary | trace Identified, Locked carrying { Mind nexus Primary }, Delivered; delivered to Mind Primary |
| 9 | message-flow-none-above | F6* F7* F8 | Up from Mind Primary | Refused.NoneAbove from the lock; no Deliver in the trace |
| 10 | message-flow-unidentified | F6* F8 F11 | send from an unbound pane | Refused.Unidentified.… |
| 11 | pending | F2 F3 F6* F8 | a Flow stand-in holds Deliver; Message stopped after Locked, started again, then a send | Refused.Held.Lock, then Delivered. Needs a Flow stand-in |
| 12 | message-flow-unreachable | F2 F6* | Flow stopped, then send | Refused.FlowUnreachable |
| 13 | message-flow-first-configure | F2 | ordinary, meta, ordinary Configure | Configured, Configured, Refused.AlreadyConfigured |
| 14 | message-flow-restart | F2 F6* F8 | Message restarted with no arguments | send Delivered, no new Configure |
| 15 | message-flow-unreadable | — | unreadable datom to `message` | CLI refuses; no connection traced |
| 16 | message-flow-bind | F2 F6* F8 | message-nexus started | Flow's trace shows Bind of { Field message Primary } with Message's pid and start time; a send succeeds |
| 17 | message-flow-not-message | F2 F8 | the `flow` CLI sends Lock, Deliver, Release | each Refused.NotMessage; its Identify is answered |
| 18 | message-flow-start-refused | F2 | a second message-nexus while the first lives; Flow stopped, then message-nexus started | nonzero exit, trace names Taken, the first still serves; nonzero exit, nothing listens, trace names FlowUnreachable, no restart |
| 19 | message-flow-rebind | F2 F6* F8 | message-nexus killed, started again | Flow's trace shows the Bind answered Bound; a send succeeds |
| 20 | message-flow-marker | F2 | fresh store: ordinary Configure, meta Configure moving a socket, ordinary Configure | Configured, RestartRequired, Refused.AlreadyConfigured |
| 21 | message-flow-old-store | F14 | old Message's version-1 store at the store path | start refused, trace names the path, store checksum unchanged |
| 24 | message-flow-reaped | F6* F8 | message-nexus stopped by SIGSTOP; a client connects, sends, is killed and reaped by its shell; SIGCONT | Message's trace names ESRCH; no Identify and no Lock in Flow's trace; the recipient's pane lacks the request; then an unbound pane's send puts an Identify in Flow's trace. Witnesses the ESRCH path on a kernel of 6.16 or later, not a pid reuse; fails against the pinned message-nexus 0.19.1, which runs no section-6 guard |
| 25 | pending | F8 | sender's metaflow has no Flow record at Lock | Refused.Unknown.Address naming the sender. Needs a Flow stand-in that emits Identified.Address then Refused.Unknown.Address on Flow's design ordinary wire; that wire (Bind, Lock, Identify, Deliver, Release and the design refusals) is in no published signal-flow — the pinned flow builds signal-flow 11.0.0 (068f0ea) whose Query carries only the 0.25.0 operations — so it cannot be emitted without inventing a contract |
| 27 | message-flow-sender-ended | F6* F8 | the sender's metaflow Ended while its shell runs, then it sends | Refused.Ended.… naming the sender |
| 28 | message-flow-wrong-binary | F2 | a message-nexus copied to another store path is started | nonzero exit naming NotMessage; nothing listens |
| 29 | message-flow-not-configured | F2 F6* F8 | message-nexus started before Flow holds Configure.Nexus, then after it | nonzero exit, nothing listens, trace names NotConfigured; then a send is Delivered |
| 31 | pending | F2 | Flow answers NotMessage to Message's Lock after its start Bind | Message answers the sender Refused.NotMessage and exits nonzero naming NotMessage. No route through Message alone: Flow answers NotMessage to a bound Message only when its executable changes, which needs a helper, or when MessageNexusBinary changes under it, and neither design says Flow takes a second Configure.Nexus |
| 22 | message-flow-claude | F1 F4 F6* F10 | Notice then Order to a Claude metaflow asleep after Stop | Queued, Woken; first prompt ends with the queue, Order last |
| 23 | message-flow-claude | F1 F4 F6* F10 | Order to working Claude flow | placed by Flow's rule; transcript holds it once |

F6* is not its first option: no tiers, per design. The request carries no
priority head (`Send.{ { Mind nexus Secondary } Order.«…» }`).
F7*: Flow resolves Up, per design.

Test 30, the bound Message process replaced through execve, is Flow's gate
and is tested in flow-test as `flow-lock-message-exec` (flow-test 446478).

## Running

    nix flake check --no-build --option allow-import-from-derivation false
    nix flake check --keep-going -L
    MESSAGE_TEST_LIVE=1 MESSAGE_TEST_SKILL_VARIABLES=<skill variables file> \
      nix run .#message-flow-claude

The semi-sandbox starts Flow with `Start.{ ordinary meta }`, its sockets
under the sandbox root, and launches flows; Launch needs Flow's
`Configure.Nexus`. The runner reads its fields at run time from the skill
variables file (`Name: value` lines, a list space-separated), builds each
value whole, and stops before any Launch, naming each variable missing.
CodexEndpoint and HarnessProfile are meta-signal-flow's at 88f37592, the
revision Flow 0.25.0 pins.

| Skill variable | Field |
|---|---|
| `Flow source root` | SourceRoot, String |
| `Flow stable Codex client path` | StableCodex ClientPath, String |
| `Flow stable Codex home` | StableCodex Home, String |
| `Flow stable Codex control socket path` | StableCodex ControlSocketPath, String |
| `Flow stable Codex model names` | StableCodex Vector<ModelName>, Strings |
| `Flow next Codex client path` | NextCodex ClientPath, String |
| `Flow next Codex home` | NextCodex Home, String |
| `Flow next Codex control socket path` | NextCodex ControlSocketPath, String |
| `Flow next Codex model names` | NextCodex Vector<ModelName>, Strings |
| `Flow Codex command sigils` | HarnessProfile Codex: Vector<CommandSigil>, Strings |
| `Flow Codex interrupt keys` | HarnessProfile Codex: InterruptKeys, Vector<KeyName> |
| `Flow Codex submit keys` | HarnessProfile Codex: SubmitKeys, Vector<KeyName> |
| `Flow Claude command sigils` | HarnessProfile Claude: Vector<CommandSigil>, Strings |
| `Flow Claude interrupt keys` | HarnessProfile Claude: InterruptKeys, Vector<KeyName> |
| `Flow Claude submit keys` | HarnessProfile Claude: SubmitKeys, Vector<KeyName> |
| `Flow meta aspects` | MetaAspects, Vector<Aspect>, aspect names such as `Field Mind` |

MessageNexusPath is the sandbox's own Message ordinary socket, and Lease
takes the design's default, 60 seconds. `checks/skill-variable.nix` runs the
reader over `fixtures/skill-variable/sample.md`.

## 3. flake.lock entries for signal-flow a991c149 and signal e0e3c055
Absent. The candidate commit 13378c4 contains flake.lock (it is unchanged from its parent) and a search of it for a991c149, e0e3c055 and "signal" finds nothing. 4d40751 holds none either. The candidate adds the two inputs to flake.nix without locking them, so Field must lock them after the merge (nix flake lock) to obtain the entries.

## 4. Per-file diff against the candidate base (9409cb7) and disposition

### README.md
Candidate diff: none (README.md identical at 13378c4 and 9409cb7).

Disposition: keep 4d40751. Its README carries test 24 as message-flow-reaped, the Flow pin 9b006dd and the new pending list. The test 25 row and the pending list stay unchanged because the candidate edits no README; the test 25 row still says pending. If the stand-in is meant to turn test 25 on, the row edit is a separate change that comes with the check file, which the candidate does not bring.

4d40751 changed nothing in this file, so the candidate applies as it is. The new key flowStandIn sits in components beside flow and herdr; it needs packages/flow-stand-in.nix and fixtures/message-flow/flow-stand-in/ from the candidate.

packages/flow-stand-in.nix, fixtures/message-flow/flow-stand-in/{Cargo.toml,Cargo.lock,src/lib.rs,src/main.rs}. Take all five.

## Open items for Field
- flake.lock needs the two new locks (item 3).
- The candidate has no check file for test 25 and no README row change; the stand-in is a package and fixture only. This is a witnessed fact about the commit, not a defect claim.
