# Signal

## Minimal response types by default, with truncated hashes; the full explicit type by an explicit call; a design standard in a skill for specifying Signal

Context: answer to the Message signal sketch shown whole as a Signal file. Ends with a question, answered in the reply: whether a signal skill exists (it does not). Logged directly by the main flow.

> Your spec is good for the messages, but we need a small response. We need an efficient system, like a summary style or minimal style. You could have this minimal provenance response, which has a truncated hash in place of a hash. These hashes are too expensive.

If there are fields that aren't necessarily needed, they can just live in the database and be queryable. The flow can query for them, and then we don't need to include all of those fields in these minimal response types. You would have an explicit type of call to get the full explicit response type.
