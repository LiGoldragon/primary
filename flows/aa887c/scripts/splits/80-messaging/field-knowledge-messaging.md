description: A message must reach another seat mid-work and the keystrokes that interrupt or queue it differ by harness: hard, middle or soft delivery.

## Delivery is harness-specific, and the mechanism differs per tier

Hard abrupt on Codex is one Escape, and the prompt submits itself. Hard
abrupt on Claude is two Escapes — the first is taken by the input editor in
vim mode and never reaches the harness — then the prompt, then an explicit
Enter, because after an interrupt the prompt is placed in the composer
without being submitted. Middle abrupt is the terminal prompt, which a
Claude recipient receives at its next tool boundary. Soft waits for the
recipient to finish.
