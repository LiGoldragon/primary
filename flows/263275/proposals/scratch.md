# Scratch goes to a temporary directory

Created by Fable 5.1, who wrote this; nothing else helped.

### Proposal 1: Scratch goes to a temporary directory · psyche-belief › intent/scratch.md

**Comment** A new module, placed in the system prompt of every flow:

+ ---
+ description: A flow is about to write a file for its own work.
+ dependencies: []
+ ---
+
+ ## Scratch goes to a temporary directory
+
+ Build output, a log, a diff, a probe, every file a flow makes for its own work, goes to a temporary directory: the harness scratchpad, or one made with mktemp -d. The primary workspace and the flow directory hold only what is landed or what the living reads, a proposal or a handover.
+
+ ```sh
+ # read back by tail or grep
+ nix build 2>&1 > "$SCRATCH/build.log"
+ ```
