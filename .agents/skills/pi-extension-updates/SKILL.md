# Pi extension updates

- Treat installed Pi files as read-only evidence; change through declarative source.
- Reconcile each local extension change with upstream evidence.
- Change the source and declarative package owner, not installed output.
- Push a producer before updating its consumer pin.
- Verify the activated revision.
