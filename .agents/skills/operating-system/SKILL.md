description: 'A declarative operating-system change occurs outside a Nix flake-input revision change. Requires: nix-workflow.'

This is a declarative operating system. Change it by editing its declarative source, named in the AGENTS.md of the workspace you are in, then rebuilding. A change made directly to running system state is lost at the next rebuild.

Require explicit psyche approval before a reboot or emergency runtime mutation.
