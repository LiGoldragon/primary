## What sema is

Sema is the database engine of a Nexus, authored in Ethos so the
stored types are visible; its root, Sema, declares record types. It
matters more than nexus, because operational editing should yield the
migration with the edit.

```
Sema
[]                                                        ; imports
[ Lock.{ LockId LockName FlowId LockPaths LockReason } ]  ; record types
                                                          ; the remaining sections are to be decided
```
