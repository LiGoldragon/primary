# Flow Nexus

## What it does

The Flow Nexus sets up and starts a model flow: its working
directory, system prompt, training files and instruction prompt. It
takes the place of the abandoned training daemon.

## Starting flows

A Nexus component decides the system prompt and everything about a
launch, replacing the harness's subagents with specialized harnesses
launched with specialized system prompts.

## Repository and skills

The flow repository holds the machinery of the Flow Nexus and is a
runtime repository. Every skill lives outside it, the basic skills
included, so that a change to a skill causes no Nix rebuild. The
basic skills give our own take on how an agent behaves in a harness,
replacing the prompt the harnesses build in.

## A session is named after its direct ancestor

A session cannot be named for what it will become, because nothing is known
about it when it is created. Its ancestor is known exactly, so the ancestor
is the name.

## A replaced session is reaped by the refresh itself

Reaping belongs to the refresh event, not to a later sweep. A refreshed flow
takes the replaced end out of receiving messages, so a dead end is never
left registered and addressable.

## Subflows replace the harness subagent facility

The harness subagent facility is replaced. It puts two flows into one
synchronous user interface and locks them both into a single main
flow. A subflow is instead an independent flow with its own system
prompt, which can reply to the successor of whoever it was meant to
answer; that makes the system asynchronous. Subflows run under their
own system prompts because they need different prompts.

## Subflows are created from the questions and requests a flow ends with

Creating a subflow is a routing job: whether there is already a flow
that should simply get this message or this question. A special field
flow running on ultra-low power checks every question and every
request a flow ends with, and, according to the ending flow's
authority, spawns subflows given those questions and requests to
answer or fulfill.

## The requester holds only a request ID

The requester holds nothing of the subflow itself. It is assigned a
request ID, by which it asks later for status, asks for more detail
about what that subflow is doing, and sends the subflow messages
while it is alive. When the subflow is done, the requester receives a
message if it is still the flow in charge.
