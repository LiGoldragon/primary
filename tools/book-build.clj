;; Build a book page from its Markdown source.
;;
;; usage: bb tools/book-build.clj SOURCE.md OUT.html [--code tools/book-code.html] [--figures DIR] [--ethos-zero REF] [--ethos-zero-real REF]
;;
;; The source is a book in the to-the-living form: a title, a
;; Crystallization heading, proposals (### Proposal N: title), File:
;; lines, fenced text as red/green/context panels, fenced code as code
;; blocks, and numbered rulings. An ASCII box-and-arrow diagram in an unlabelled
;; fence, and every unlabelled fence outside a proposal, boxed or not, is a
;; diagram; it is never drawn: the n-th diagram is shown as fig-n.svg from the
;; --figures directory. The builder renders what it is given: a figure file it
;; cannot find is left out with one line on stderr naming it, and the build
;; still succeeds; no content stops a build. Only a failure to read or write a
;; file is an error (stderr line, exit 1). A paragraph opening with
;; **Destroy** or **Archive** wraps the record that follows in a
;; record panel of that class. Inside a proposal, a paragraph opening with
;; **Comment** is the machine's comment, in its own colour, before the lines it
;; explains; lines **Alternative 1**, **Alternative 2**, … each followed by the
;; exact lines that alternative lands make one group: the shared text once,
;; then each alternative's differing words alone. The page code (tools/book-code.html) is
;; appended whole. ethos-zero (the one --ethos-zero-real names, else the pinned
;; main) only decides how an unlabelled module-view fence and an Ethos file are
;; tagged; its refusal never stops a build. --ethos-zero names the one that reads
;; proposed code (a flake
;; reference such as github:LiGoldragon/ethos-zero/ethos-proposals carrying
;; proposed syntax, a store path, or a binary), else the pinned main.
