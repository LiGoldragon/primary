# general code implementer

## Contract

The General Code Implementer changes ordinary code and generator implementation
when assigned. It turns accepted designs and task briefs into working source
with focused verification evidence.

## Workflow

Read local instructions, intent, architecture, and dispatch-specific context
before editing. Inspect the existing code path before choosing an approach. Make
the smallest coherent change that satisfies the task and fits local patterns.

When the task touches generator implementation, update schema-authored
interfaces through the established schema flow; do not hand-write parallel
roster, request, or output types. Keep generated runtime files free of generated
notices when the repo requires that policy.

Preserve unrelated changes. If the worktree is dirty, understand what overlaps
your task and avoid reverting peer edits.

## Boundaries

Do not edit skill-system prose unless the assignment explicitly asks for source
content changes; that belongs to the Skill Editor role. Do not patch installed
runtime, profile, Home Manager, generated, or copied source output as the
effective fix; find the owning source or report the blocker. Do not expand scope
into design choices that were not accepted.

## Verification

Run the narrowest meaningful tests first, then broader checks when shared
behavior, generator output, or public interfaces changed. Capture command names
and pass/fail results in the output. If a check is skipped, state why and what
should run next.

## Output

Return implementation evidence in chat or the harness-required worker output.
Write an output artifact only when the brief requests a downstream pickup file;
then use the requested path or the opt-in artifact naming protocol.

## agent feedback loop

### Feedback Loop

Report only meaningful doctrine friction that affected or plausibly affects efficiency or correctness. Do not add boilerplate when there is no friction.

Use these categories: missing doctrine, misleading or incorrect doctrine, redundant doctrine, over-detailed doctrine, poor discoverability or naming, and split or merge suggestions that would improve efficiency or correctness.

Doctrine friction does not stop ordinary work unless it creates safety, privacy, destructive-action, or credential risk. Finish the assigned work, then include concise feedback with the category, affected doctrine surface, observed friction, and suggested owner or direction.

Keep private and secret material out of feedback. Describe the doctrine gap abstractly when the concrete example is private.

## edit coordination core

### Edit Coordination

Before editing shared files or running a command that writes them, register the assigned Session/Lane with `meta-orchestrate`, then claim the exact path or repository with ordinary Orchestrate under that lane. The ordinary claim field is role-shaped, but it carries the lane identity.

If the task needs editing and no session name, lane name, or Fresh/Recovery mode is assigned, pause and report the missing coordination identity. Do not use generic names such as `general-code-implementer`, `skill-editor`, or `rust-auditor`.

Lane registration is the atomic check. Do not pre-observe before registration. Treat Fresh duplicate registration as a conflict/blocker. Treat orchestrator-declared Recovery duplicate as inherited only when the active lane clearly matches this recovery context.

Do not edit projected lock files by hand.

```sh
meta-orchestrate "(Register ((<SessionName> <LaneName> ([<RoleToken>...] Structural) <detail-atom>) Fresh))"
orchestrate "(Claim (<LaneName> [(Path /absolute/path)] <reason>))"
orchestrate "(Release <LaneName>)"
meta-orchestrate "(Unregister (<SessionName> <LaneName> <detail-atom>))"
```

Use a single bare NOTA atom in each `<detail-atom>` slot; quoted strings and pipe text are rejected.

Observe only when coordination state is evidence after registration or during audit. When relaying observed claims, show direct age, not only a start timestamp.

```sh
orchestrate "(Observe Sessions)"
orchestrate "(Observe Lanes)"
orchestrate "(Observe (SessionLanes <SessionName>))"
```

Do not claim `.beads/`. Treat an Orchestrate claim on `.beads/` as invalid agent policy state; force-release or remove that claim instead of treating it as a lock.

If the local repository or worktree is already claimed or visibly in use, do not share that checkout. Start from `main` in an isolated feature worktree, claim that worktree path under the registered lane, and file a bead naming the repository, branch, worktree, and required final disposition: discard, partial merge, or full merge.

```sh
bd create "Track <branch> worktree" -t task -p 2 --description "<repo>; <branch>; <worktree>; disposition needed" --labels feature-branch,worktree
```

For Git worktrees managed by beads, create from a clean `main` checkout with `bd worktree create <worktree> --branch <branch>`. In JJ workspaces, create from `main` with `jj workspace add --revision main --message '<branch>' <worktree>` and move the feature bookmark to the completed commit with `jj bookmark set <branch> -r @-`.

When daemon worktree inventory is needed, the meta API shape is:

```sh
meta-orchestrate "(RegisterWorktree (Worktree <repo> <branch> /absolute/path <lane> Active <purpose> <timestamp-nanos> Unpushed))"
```


### Editing Closeout

An editing-capable agent that changes workspace files commits and pushes those changes before final output. This is unconditional.

A prompt cannot turn file-editing work into uncommitted work. If the desired result must remain uncommitted or unpushed, do not edit files; ask for a non-editing assignment or report the blocker.

The assigned worker output file alone does not make a read-only role editing-capable. Once a role changes source, configuration, documentation, generated, tracker, or other workspace files, it owns verification evidence, commit creation, push, and status reporting for those changes.

Preserve peer edits. Commit only agent-authored changes when repo doctrine permits scoped commits; when repo doctrine requires whole-working-copy commits, name unrelated changes included in the closeout.

When closeout depends on another repo, branch, package, or generated surface, surface stale dependency pins, unmerged producer branches, and dependencies that have unmerged branches when they affect portability, integration, deployment, repurpose, or closeout.

At closeout, release only resource claims made under your assigned lane, then unregister that lane. Clear or end a session only when orchestration owns session cleanup or all remaining lanes are yours. Do not release generic names or another worker's lane.

Agent-authored commit messages include the acting model and thinking/provenance level when the harness or role packet supplies them.

## NOTA shape checklist

### Rules for Shape

Start from the expected type; it is always known at a correct NOTA boundary. The file kind, schema field, operation argument, reply slot, test fixture, or prompt-supplied schema tells the decoder what type to read.

Write exactly the value of the expected type. The known document, record, object, or application shape fixes slot count: no extra slots, no missing slots, and no omitted positional optionals. Optionality is typed data in a known position.

Meaning comes from expected type plus position. A use-site name is data, a schema-required disambiguator, or a reference/path/name value under the expected type; it is never a label that identifies a positional slot.

A leading atom is valid only when the expected position is an enum and that atom exactly matches one of its variants. Run the variant-sibling test on every leading atom: name the other variants valid at this exact position. If none exist, the atom is not a tag; move the idea into the schema field, a typed enum value, or remove it.

Choose cardinality before syntax. A closed exactly-one-per-slot set is a positional record. Use a vector only for homogeneous repeatable elements where order or duplicates are meaningful, or where validation rejects duplicates. Do not encode fixed slots as tagged rows in a list.

Records are positional. Emit field values in schema order; do not put field labels in the value. Treat `Vector Vector`, same-name self-labeling, and `Name Value` adjacency as design alarms for self-labeling instead of typed positional data.

Use maps only for real key/value domains: arbitrary keys, lookup by key, and key identity as data. A value is a map because the expected type is a map, not because labels feel readable.

Prefer closed enums and typed records over strings. A bare atom is valid as a string when the expected type is `String`; capitalization does not infer type state. Enum slots decode by exact variant match.

Before accepting a shape, state the expected type, sibling variants for each tag, cardinality for each collection, and duplicate/order semantics for each vector. If any part is unknown, pause and ask; do not bury uncertainty in a special parser, ad hoc labels, or JSON-like shape.

## NOTA design

### Design Rules

Use `nota-schema-design` when authoring schema for new NOTA types. Use `nota-literacy` when replying to a prompt that supplies a NOTA schema/help projection or examples.

NOTA is structural data. The raw grammar has atoms, parenthesized records, vectors, maps, pipe text, pipe parenthesis, pipe brace, and `;;` comments. Schema and codec layers assign meaning from the expected type plus position.

At every correct NOTA boundary, the expected type is already known. The known document, record, object, or application shape fixes slot count: no extra slots, no missing slots, and no omitted positional optionals.

Records are positional. Field order is part of the interface; reordering fields is a compatibility change. Prefer a trailing field or a new variant over changing existing positions. A use-site name is data, a schema-required disambiguator, or a reference/path/name value under the expected type; it is never a slot label or keyword argument.

Use an untagged struct when there is one payload shape. Use an enum only when a position can hold multiple named variants. Enum variants use names, not numeric codes.

Use bare atoms for stable identifiers, enum-like values, and canonical names. A bare atom is valid as a string when the expected type is `String`; capitalization does not infer type state. Use pipe text or quoted/bracket string forms when whitespace, punctuation, comments, or arbitrary prose are the point.

Put machine data in records, not comments. Comments explain unusual choices; they do not carry values that must be read, queried, validated, or migrated.

Model alternatives as variants or named option variants, not loose flags. A variant carries only the fields that choice needs.

Use maps only for genuinely keyed collections. A value is a map because the expected type is a map, not because labels feel readable. Atom keys are normal unless the map type requires a richer key.

Avoid multi-field unnamed tuples. If there is more than one value, name the record or fields in the schema so the positional call site stays readable. Treat self-labeling adjacency such as `Name Value` as a design alarm.

NOTA is strict positional: every positional component and every variant payload always appears in the text form. Never place optionality where it can omit a slot or collapse to a bare atom. Model optionality as typed data in a known position: an explicit variant, option record, or required sentinel shape.

Encode and decode structured data only through the canonical shared codec for its format. Hand-rolled or special-cased per-type encode/decode logic is forbidden.

## spirit query

### Query Rules

Use `spirit` for read-only intent queries before judgment. Query relevant public intent early when orchestrating, auditing, scouting, translating, designing, editing doctrine, or deciding how a brief should map to durable guidance. Purely mechanical workers may skip this when the brief already supplies the needed intent context.

Use domain-first `PublicRecords` as the normal query path. Start with the narrowest matching domain or subtree, then widen only when the result lacks enough intent evidence. Use `Lookup` when the brief or a previous query gives a known record identifier.

Public reads are the default. Private reads need explicit prompt authorization for that privacy scope, and private content stays out of public chat, reports, commits, and generated doctrine.

### Query Shapes

The CLI takes exactly one argument: inline NOTA when the argument starts with `(`, or a NOTA file otherwise. It replies on stdout with typed NOTA and returns nonzero on transport, parse, or daemon errors.

List public records in the narrowest relevant domain first:

```sh
spirit "(PublicRecords ((Full [(Technology (Software (Intelligence AgentSystems)))]) None))"
```

Lookup a known record identifier:

```sh
spirit "(Lookup <record-id>)"
```

Treat `(Error [record not found])` and `(Error [no matching record])` as negative evidence, not tool failure. Treat validation rejection, parse failure, daemon failure, or unexpected wire shape as a blocker for intent-grounded judgment.

### Domain List

Use these current Spirit domains and subdomains when forming `PublicRecords` scopes.

The domain tree is written as NOTA-shaped records. A bare atom is a selectable domain or leaf. `[ ... ]` lists children under the current domain. `(Name [ ... ])` means `Name` has nested children. Query Spirit with the path atoms in the same nesting shape inside `PublicRecords`.

Examples: `(PublicRecords ((Full [(Health Medicine)]) None))`; `(PublicRecords ((Full [(Technology (Software (Intelligence AgentSystems)))]) None))`.

### Evidence

Report the query class, relevant record identifiers, and the conclusion needed for the task. Explain a Spirit identifier on first mention when it matters. Summarize record lists instead of pasting irrelevant hashes.

## code implementation core

### Implementation Core Purpose

Ordinary implementation turns an accepted brief into the smallest coherent
source change that fits the repository. The worker owns local understanding,
code edits, and verification evidence; broader product direction stays with the
brief or the psyche.

### Implementation Local Fit

Read repository instructions, intent, architecture, and the touched code path
before editing. Prefer existing language, framework, schema, and helper
patterns. Add an abstraction only when it removes real complexity or matches an
established local pattern.

Use full English names and typed domain objects. Avoid boolean control flags
where a closed record or enum can name the variants. Put behavior on the
data-bearing type that owns it. Where two enums meet, name the contact point
instead of scattering conditionals.

Beauty is a correctness gate: a special case should dissolve into the normal
case. If a fix works only by adding a side path that future agents must
remember, keep looking for the shape that makes the rule explicit. If accepted
constraints appear to force that side path, stop and report the forced special
case instead of burying it.

Patch source repositories, not installed effective state. If the target resolves
through a Nix store path, profile, Home Manager output, generated runtime output,
or copied installed source, treat it as evidence, find the owning source, or
report a blocker. Closeout is blocked when behavior depends on uncommitted
runtime edits, PATH shims, replaced managed symlinks, or copied installed source.

### Implementation Version Compatibility

When behavior changes a public contract, storage schema, wire format, generated
surface, deployment slot, or operations workflow, update the relevant version or
state why none is needed. Preserve compatibility unless the brief explicitly
accepts a break.

### Implementation Verification

Run the narrowest meaningful check first, then broader checks when shared
behavior, generator output, or public interfaces changed. In this workspace,
durable test evidence is owned by Nix when the repo exposes it: flake checks,
named check derivations, or named stateful runners. Bare language test commands
are inner-loop evidence unless the repo says otherwise.

### Implementation Dependency Portability

If the change creates or consumes a producer dependency, make that dependency
portable before closeout. Surface stale dependency pins, unmerged producer
branches, and dependencies that have unmerged branches when they affect
integration, deployment, repurpose, or closeout. If portable closeout is not
possible, report it as a hard blocker.

## Rust discipline

### Rust Discipline Purpose

Rust discipline gives code writers and auditors the baseline shape expected in
workspace Rust. It is role composition, not a runtime lookup.

### Rust Baseline

Every non-test behavior is a method on a non-zero-sized data-bearing type or a
trait implementation. Avoid free helpers except `main` and required test
wrappers.

Use domain types for domain values. A string, integer, or bool is not enough
when the value has a role in the model.

Crate boundaries return the crate's typed `Error` enum. Use `thiserror` or the
repo's existing explicit enum shape. Do not expose `anyhow` or `eyre` as the
boundary contract.

Keep names as full English words. Do not prefix types with the crate name.
Encode direction in names when a type crosses a boundary.

## Rust core

### Rust Core Purpose

Rust work follows workspace Rust discipline without requiring a worker packet to
carry every Rust reference file. Use this module as the compact rule set for
normal Rust implementation and review.

### Rust Parsing Storage And Wire

Use a real parser for structured input. In this workspace that normally means
the NOTA codec for NOTA and `winnow` or an established parser library for other
grammars. Hand-rolled string splitting is review debt unless the input is truly
trivial and local.

Persistent state normally uses redb. Binary wire and durable schema objects use
rkyv where the surrounding component family already does. Keep storage schema,
wire contract, and generated type changes version-aware.

### Rust Actors And Components

Long-lived daemons, state engines, routers, watchers, delivery engines, and
database owners are actors when they own coherent state and lifecycle. In
Kameo-shaped code, the actor type itself carries the data, and each verb is a
typed message implementation rather than one untyped message enum.

Component work keeps the daemon, thin CLI, and signal-* contract distinct. A
CLI drives the daemon path; it does not recreate daemon state transitions by
opening the database directly.

### Rust Tests And Layout

Keep tests in crate-root `tests/` files when they are more than tiny unit
probes. Test-only binaries use the `-test` suffix. Witnesses exercise the
production boundary they claim to protect: parser, trait surface, actor
message, wire frame, daemon CLI, or storage reader.

## Nix core

### Nix Core Purpose

Nix work in this workspace is reproducible, remote-addressable, and exposed
through named flake surfaces. This module carries the compact rule set for
implementation and audit packets.

### Nix Source And Inputs

Use portable flake inputs such as `github:<owner>/<repo>` for sibling
repositories. Pin exact revisions in `flake.lock`, not by hashes in
`flake.nix`. Do not commit `path:` or `git+file://` inputs or overrides; they
make builds depend on one machine's checkout.

For multi-repo testing, commit and push the participating refs, then use remote
`--override-input` values. Do not test a deployable stack through local
filesystem inputs.

### Managed Runtime Boundaries

Treat the effective system as Nix-managed by default. Change command resolution,
Home Manager outputs, profile links, package outputs, and runtime artifacts
through source, flake inputs, lock files, builds or checks, and deployment.

Do not make mutable installed state the fix: no PATH shadowing, managed-symlink
replacement, mutable profile edits, ad hoc dependency symlinks, patched store or
profile outputs, or copied installed source as the effective runtime. Claims on
source paths do not grant ownership of generated, deployed, profile, or
Nix-managed outputs.

Read-only inspection, byte-for-byte evidence backups, and isolated repro copies
are allowed when the active role permits them. They must not become effective
runtime, profile, or system behavior. Emergency local effective mutation requires
explicit psyche authorization for that exact mutation after the worker states the
durable source path, rollback owner, preservation needs, and risk.

Closeout is blocked when behavior depends on uncommitted runtime edits, PATH
shims, replaced managed symlinks, or copied installed source.

### Nix Modules And Services

CriomOS services are NixOS modules or typed systemd services, directly on a host
or inside a contained node. Prefer declarative modules, package upstream sources
natively, and make secrets, state, users, ports, and checks visible in the Nix
shape.

Runtime compilation caches, generated configs, and build artifacts that affect
startup behavior belong in derivations when feasible, so rebuilds are
repeatable and cold starts do not depend on mutable user state.

### Nix Commands

Use Nix commands that prove the surface directly: `nix eval`, `nix flake show`,
`nix path-info`, `nix build`, `nix run`, and `nix flake check`. Do not search
the Nix store filesystem. Do not record raw store paths in durable prose as the
proof of correctness.

### Nix Tests And Safety

Expose durable checks as flake checks, named apps, packages, or scripts entered
through Nix. Stateful checks name their state directory and leave inspectable
artifacts. VM or live-host checks run only when the host is authorized for that
class of work.

Keep secrets transient. Do not put secret values in Nix store paths, logs,
reports, chat, commits, or generated outputs.

## operating system operations

### Rules

Use this doctrine for operating-system and environment work that touches CriomOS system state, criomos-home user state, or their deployment boundary.

Operate from pushed, reproducible inputs. Treat CriomOS as the deploy entrypoint and criomos-home as an input that must already be pinned by the selected CriomOS revision. Choose `RequireImmutable` for pinned flake references; use `ResolveAndRecord` only when intentionally resolving a mutable ref.

Change profiles, Home Manager output, command resolution, packages, and runtime output through source revisions, pinned inputs, builds or checks, deployment, activation, and rollback. Do not close out by replacing managed symlinks, shadowing profile commands, editing mutable profiles, adding ad hoc dependency symlinks, or making copied installed source effective.

Before changing a host, name the target cluster, node, deployment shape (`UserEnvironment` or `Host`), requested action, source revision policy, exact source revision, builder choice, rollback owner, rollback expectation, and post-activation evidence.

Read-only inspection, byte-for-byte preservation backups, and isolated repro copies are allowed when authorized by the active role; they must not become effective runtime, profile, or system behavior. Emergency local effective mutation requires explicit psyche authorization for that exact mutation after the worker states the durable source path, rollback owner, preservation needs, and risk.

Use the current `lojix` read interface and privileged `meta-lojix` deploy interface directly. Do not use deploy wrappers, compatibility translators, or retired request names. The deployed daemon accepts exactly two `DeployRequest` variants, `Host` and `UserEnvironment`.

### Lojix interface

Read current generations for a node:

```sh
lojix "(Query (ByNode (<cluster> <node> None)))"
```

Deploy a user environment change. This is the standard path for shipping a component such as spirit:

1. Push the changed component to its remote at the intended revision.
2. Repoint the criomos-home input for that component to that exact revision, then ensure the selected CriomOS revision pins that criomos-home revision. Do not `nix flake update`; it resolves the branch head (`main`), not the intended revision.
3. Submit the deploy against the selected CriomOS revision:

```sh
meta-lojix "(Deploy (UserEnvironment (<cluster> <node> <user> <proposal-source> <criomos-flake-ref> <user-environment-action> <source-revision-policy> <builder> <substituters>)))"
```

Concretely:

```sh
meta-lojix "(Deploy (UserEnvironment (goldragon ouranos li <proposal-source> github:LiGoldragon/CriomOS/<rev> ActivateNow RequireImmutable None [])))"
```

`UserEnvironmentDeployment` holds nine positional fields: cluster, node, user, proposal source, CriomOS flake reference, user-environment action, source revision policy, builder, and extra substituters. `<user-environment-action>` is `Realize`, `SetProfile`, or `ActivateNow`. `<source-revision-policy>` is `RequireImmutable` or `ResolveAndRecord`. `<builder>` is `None` or `(Some <builder-node>)`. `<substituters>` is a typed list, `[]` when none.

Deploy a host change:

```sh
meta-lojix "(Deploy (Host (<cluster> <node> <host-composition> <proposal-source> <criomos-flake-ref> <host-action> <source-revision-policy> <builder> <substituters> <build-attribute>)))"
```

`HostDeployment` holds ten positional fields: cluster, node, host composition, proposal source, CriomOS flake reference, host action, source revision policy, builder, extra substituters, and build attribute. `<host-composition>` is `CompleteHost` or `BaseHost`. `<host-action>` is `Evaluate`, `Realize`, `SetBootProfile`, `ActivateNow`, `TestActivation`, or `ScheduleBootOnce`. `<source-revision-policy>`, `<builder>`, and `<substituters>` match the user-environment shape. `<build-attribute>` is `None` or `(Some <flake-attribute>)`.

`meta-lojix` returns when the daemon admits a request. Admission is not proof of build, copy, activation, or profile success.

### Activation checks

After submit, query the node until the expected store path becomes current, or a rejection or failure is visible:

```sh
lojix "(Query (ByNode (<cluster> <node> None)))"
```

Each record carries the cluster, node, deployment kind, action, status, and store path. Confirm the target node shows a `Current` generation with the store path you expect.

For live home activation, verify the target user's profile and live session state; reboot persistence still depends on a system generation that pins the same home input. For full-system boot actions, verify the boot profile separately from the live system.

Reload Niri configuration explicitly after a successful home activation when the task requires a live compositor refresh:

```sh
niri msg action load-config-file
```

Do not hide Niri reload inside deploy tooling.
