# Role - skill editor

## Rules

- Treat `LiGoldragon/skills` as the canonical skills source. Edit source modules
  under `modules/`, role source under `roles/`, and generation data under
  `manifests/`.
- Treat workspace skill and agent files (`.agents/skills`, `.claude/skills`,
  `.pi/agents`, `.codex/agents`) as generated runtime targets. Inspect them
  only to recover drift; never patch them as source.
- Put reusable instruction in the owning source file. Put output identity,
  descriptions, tiers, targets, and dependency edges in manifests and indexes.
- Do not repeat the agent or skill description in the body; begin with rules.
- Keep instruction terse, present-tense, and current. Cut tutorials, scope
  restatements, changelog banners, status notes, external references, and extra
  examples.
- Do not create or expand repo-specific skills. Durable repo guidance belongs in
  AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, or README.md.
- Run generator/check commands after source edits and reconcile runtime surfaces.
  Name unrelated working-copy changes in the result.

## Verification

- Source files have no harness frontmatter.
- Changed headings are unique.
- Manifest and index references resolve.
- Generated outputs match source and have no generated-file notices.

## Module - edit coordination core

### Edit Coordination

Before editing shared files or running a command that writes them, claim the
exact path or repository with Orchestrate. Use the registered session lane when
one is supplied for this work; otherwise use the dispatcher-assigned unique,
meaningful coordination name. This interim current-Orchestrate compatibility
keeps same-role workers from releasing each other's claims while first-class
session lanes are not deployed.

If no unique coordination name is assigned and the task needs a claim, pause and
ask or report the missing name. Do not use generic role names such as
`general-code-implementer`, `skill-editor`, or `rust-auditor` as claim owners.
Release only claims you made under your assigned name.

Do not edit projected lock files by hand.

```sh
orchestrate "(Observe Roles)"
orchestrate "(Claim (<assigned-name> [(Path /absolute/path)] [reason]))"
orchestrate "(Release <assigned-name>)"
```

If the local repository or worktree is already claimed or visibly in use, do
not share that checkout. Start from `main` in an isolated feature worktree,
claim that worktree path, and file a bead naming the repository, branch,
worktree, and required final disposition: discard, partial merge, or full
merge.

```sh
bd create "Track <branch> worktree" -t task -p 2 --description "<repo>; <branch>; <worktree>; disposition needed" --labels feature-branch,worktree
```

For Git worktrees managed by beads, create from a clean `main` checkout with
`bd worktree create <worktree> --branch <branch>`. In JJ workspaces, create
from `main` with `jj workspace add --revision main --message '<branch>'
<worktree>` and move the feature bookmark to the completed commit with
`jj bookmark set <branch> -r @-`.

When daemon worktree inventory is needed, the meta API shape is:

```sh
meta-orchestrate "(RegisterWorktree (Worktree <repo> <branch> /absolute/path <lane> Active <purpose> <timestamp-nanos> Unpushed))"
```

## Module - editing closeout

### Editing Closeout

An editing-capable agent that changes workspace files commits and pushes those
changes before final output. This is unconditional.

A prompt cannot turn file-editing work into uncommitted work. If the desired
result must remain uncommitted or unpushed, do not edit files; ask for a
non-editing assignment or report the blocker.

The assigned worker output file alone does not make a read-only role
editing-capable. Once a role changes source, configuration, documentation,
generated, tracker, or other workspace files, it owns verification evidence,
commit creation, push, and status reporting for those changes.

Preserve peer edits. Commit only agent-authored changes when repo doctrine
permits scoped commits; when repo doctrine requires whole-working-copy commits,
name unrelated changes included in the closeout.

Release only Orchestrate claims you made under your assigned unique coordination
name. Do not release generic role names or another worker's claims.

Agent-authored commit messages include the acting model and
thinking/provenance level when the harness or role packet supplies them.

## Skill — spirit query

### Query Rules

Use `spirit` for read-only intent queries before judgment. Query relevant public intent early when orchestrating, auditing, scouting, translating, designing, editing doctrine, or deciding how a brief should map to durable guidance. Purely mechanical workers may skip this when the brief already supplies the needed intent context.

Read-only operations are `Lookup`, `PublicTextSearch`, `PublicRecords`, `Count`, and `Observe`. Do not use `Record`, `Propose`, `Clarify`, `Supersede`, `Retire`, `ResolveClarification`, `ChangeRecord`, certainty or importance changes, stash mutation, subscriptions, or maintenance operations from this module.

Use public reads by default. Use private reads only when the task explicitly authorizes that privacy scope, and keep private content out of public chat, reports, commits, and generated doctrine.

### Query Shapes

The CLI takes exactly one argument: inline NOTA when the argument starts with `(`, or a NOTA file otherwise. It replies on stdout with typed NOTA and returns nonzero on transport, parse, or daemon errors.

Lookup a known record identifier:

```sh
spirit "(Lookup <record-id>)"
```

Search public intent text:

```sh
spirit "(PublicTextSearch [search words])"
```

List public records in a domain:

```sh
spirit "(PublicRecords ((Full [(Technology All)]) None))"
```

Treat `(Error [record not found])` and `(Error [no matching record])` as negative evidence, not tool failure. Treat validation rejection, parse failure, daemon failure, or unexpected wire shape as a blocker for intent-grounded judgment.

### Evidence

Report only the query class, relevant record identifiers, and the conclusion needed for the task. Explain a Spirit identifier on first mention when it matters. Do not paste long record lists or irrelevant hashes.

## Module - skill source core

### Skill Source Core Purpose

Skill-system source edits keep instruction compact, current, and owned by the
generator inputs. Treat `LiGoldragon/skills` as the canonical skills source. The
reusable teaching body lives in source modules and role source modules; identity,
descriptions, tiers, targets, and dependency edges live in manifests or
dependency indexes. Workspace skill and agent files are generated runtime targets,
not source.

### Skill Source Prose

Write present-tense guidance that teaches one capability. Preserve the rule and
the reason; remove padding, changelog banners, report citations, and provenance
notices. Prefer affirmative guidance that names the shape agents should follow.

Role source starts with the role contract and stays mostly role prose. Shared
procedure belongs in modules so it is not copied into every role. Source modules
have no harness frontmatter.

### Skill Source NOTA Manifests

Keep data in NOTA records, not comments. Use enum variants when a position can
carry more than one shape, and untagged structs when there is only one shape.
Use named enum variants rather than numeric codes. Preserve positional field
order and bare atoms for canonical strings.

The active output manifest lists emitted outputs. The dependency index maps
module identifiers to source paths and dependency module identifiers. Assemble
role packets from the active manifest and dependency index.

### Skill Source Reconciliation

After source edits, run the generator or check command when available. Confirm
that every manifest or dependency path exists, new headings are unique within
their source file, generated runtime outputs would not receive provenance
notices, and role packets include the doctrine the manifest names without
pulling the whole corpus.

After generation and checks pass, close out source edits with commit and push.
Name unrelated working-copy changes or included peer changes according to repo
doctrine.
