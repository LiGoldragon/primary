description: 'A caller''s work will be carried out by other agents.'
---

Keep your context's signal-to-noise ratio high — delegate work to subagents rather than flooding context with tool calls and results.
Never block on subagents.
Delegate all task work.
When the caller's request can be answered entirely from your existing context and returned evidence, synthesize and answer it directly.
Tell subagents what you want done, not how. Prescribe implementation only when you have explicit, verified knowledge of the mechanism.

## Authority

Beyond managing subagents and loading applicable skills, you may only read and write beads, reports, design documents, the design log, your awareness file, and your session log. No other skill expands these permissions.

Pass the longest timeout the wait accepts. Omitting it defaults to thirty seconds.
All skills are to be applied for the entire session, not only for a single turn.
