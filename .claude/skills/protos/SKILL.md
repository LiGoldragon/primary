description: Reading or writing any protos dialect, or touching the protos crate.
dependencies: []
---

Protos is the style every dialect shares: the context-switching parse, the delimiters, the heads, the recursive structure. It owns the only character reader and the only character writer. It knows form and nothing else: what a structure means — struct, vector, string, integer, variant — is said by the conceptual layer that reads it, never by protos.

## Four layers

Textual, protosic, conceptual, compositional. Going down, the information gains density and strictness; going up, visibility. Each step converts into a wholly different type, and nothing of the previous step is used after it. Implement the descent as multiple passes; a single pass is not an option.

```
; textual: these characters, uninterpreted
{ Ada 1990 }
```
```rust
// protosic: an enclosure of two bare runs, each structure at its extent in the text
Protos::Enclosed { extent: Extent { start: 0, end: 12 }, enclosure: Braced, children: vec![
    Protos::Bare { extent: Extent { start: 2, end: 5 }, text: "Ada".to_owned() },
    Protos::Bare { extent: Extent { start: 6, end: 10 }, text: "1990".to_owned() } ] }
// conceptual, here datomic: a struct of two positions, each datom at its path
Datom { path: vec![], form: Form::Struct(vec![
    Datom { path: vec![0], form: Form::Bare("Ada".to_owned()) },
    Datom { path: vec![1], form: Form::Bare("1990".to_owned()) } ]) }
// compositional: the meaning fully absorbed; no position, because the tree is consumed
Person { name: String::from("Ada"), born: 1990 }
```

## Delimiters

Five pairs. `{ }`, `[ ]`, `< >` structural; `« »` opaque, every glyph content; `( )` reserved for meaning, its type unspecified, read by balance as opaque until it is. The curly quotes are not delimiters. There is no key-value map in protos or in any dialect. A brace enclosure's arity is anatomical; a bracket enclosure's is not.

## Structure

Structure is the word for every unit of the text; its type is the `Protos` enum: headed, enclosed, opaque, or bare. A headed structure is a head, a separator and a body; the separators are period, exclamation and colon; the head is a symbol; heads daisy-chain, separators differing. An enclosed structure stands between its delimiters; a bare structure has none.

## Every layer carries its own context

The extent, where a structure sits in the text, is a fact of the protosic layer, and every `Protos` node carries one. The path, where a datom sits in its tree, is a fact of the datomic layer. The budget, how much reading one act allows, is a fact of the reader and lives on it. The composition carries no position.

## Kinds

A kind is borne by the type converted and named for the layer it becomes. No type bears a kind two layers away; a chain is written in the open where it is used, never folded into a kind on its first type.

| type | kind | becomes |
|---|---|---|
| text | `Protosizable` | protos |
| `Protos` | `Textualizable` | text |
| `Protos` | `Datomizable`, or `Ethosizable` further on | its concept |
| `Datom` | `Protosizable` | protos |
| `Datom` | `Composable` | any compositional type |
| composition | `Datomizable` | datom |
| composition | `Compositional` | states its own positions, so a datom can compose it |

```rust
pub enum Protos {
    Headed { extent: Extent, head: Symbol, constraints: Option<Box<Protos>>, separator: Separator, body: Box<Protos> },
    Enclosed { extent: Extent, enclosure: Enclosure, children: Vec<Protos> },
    Opaque { extent: Extent, boundary: Boundary, content: String },
    Bare { extent: Extent, text: String },
}
pub enum Enclosure { Braced, Bracketed, Angled }
pub enum Boundary  { Guillemets, Parentheses }
pub enum Separator { Period, Exclamation, Colon }
pub struct Extent { pub start: usize, pub end: usize }
pub struct Error  { pub extent: Extent, pub problem: Problem }
pub struct ReaderBudget { pub remaining: usize }

pub trait Protosizable    { type Output; fn protosize(&self) -> Self::Output; }  // String -> Result<Protos, Error>; Datom -> Protos
pub trait Textualizable   { fn textualize(&self) -> String; }
pub trait Canonicalizable { fn canonicalize(&mut self); }

let text = person.datomize(Path::new()).protosize().textualize();
```

## String, escape, error

The text type is `String`. A closing guillemet inside a string is escaped with a backslash, so the ascent never refuses. The word is error, not fault, through the chain.

```
«she said \»no\» and left»
```

## Canonical print

A space inside every delimiter at both ends when non-empty, and never inside the guillemets, where every glyph is content and a space would be load-bearing. `Head.body` with nothing around the separator. A single `;` opens a comment to end of line; comments are not printed.
