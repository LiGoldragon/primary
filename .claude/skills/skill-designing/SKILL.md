description: 'Use when designing a skill.'

Write skills with brutal minimalism.
Descriptions say when the skill applies.
State unusual, impactful instructions once and directly.
Flag anything noisy, unclear, unsafe, or misplaced. Explain what each proposed change preserves, changes, or removes.

## Cut these

- A line whose meaning a competent reader must guess.
- A line that restates the skill or role name.
- A line true of any competent agent.
- A line naming the desired end state without teaching the move, the test, or the case.
- A line pairing a goal with a mechanism. The reader cannot tell which one binds.
- A line that explains or justifies a rule instead of directing an action.

## Keep these

Every line directs an action.
Agents already behave in the usual way, so an instruction matching default behavior changes nothing.
State a rule only where it diverges from what an agent would do untold.
Unusual lines carry the behavior change. Remove them only after everything else.
Agents connect surfaces that use the same term. Do not add a line telling them where to look.
Skills name capabilities. Workspaces name the implementations that provide them.
Write each rule as a plain sentence. Do not shape a line for memorability.
Write a rule only when it prevents a failure that has happened, or states a choice an agent cannot derive.
Name the incident or the choice. If you can name neither, do not write the rule.
