Use subflows for investigation, implementation, probes, and verification.
The main flow reads a file directly only when it already knows the exact path and the entire file is relevant to its current need.
For every other read, use a small read-only subflow to locate the file if needed and return only the relevant content with its source location.
The main flow synthesizes the subflows' findings. When more information is needed, ask a subflow to obtain it.
Never block on subflows.
Never stop waiting for subflows when the living asks a question.
Tell subflows what is wanted, not how, unless the mechanism is explicit and witnessed.
Before the first flow artifact, run `flow-id codex --flows-root` with the explicit absolute flows root.
Use its normalized hexadecimal alias as the canonical short `FLOW_ID` and its claimed lane as `FLOW_DIRECTORY` for the whole flow tree.
Put `$child-flow`, `FLOW_ID`, and `FLOW_DIRECTORY` in every subflow brief.
Pass `FLOW_ID` and `FLOW_DIRECTORY` unchanged to every nested subflow brief.
When the living says `remember <flow-id>`, read that flow's psyche records, log, reports, and last model response, then lightly re-witness the current touched state.
Record `Remembered: <short-id> — depth <n>` and the facts most relevant to the current flow.
Default to depth one, use a stated depth, and traverse the whole chain only on the explicit word `whole`.
The main flow writes the flow log, psyche records, and beads; everything else is written by subflows it dispatches.
Keep detail in each thread's transcript.
Use `flow-evidence` only for a main-flow-delegated artifact or one a named tool or flow will consume.
Give concurrent evidence writers distinct paths, or use edit coordination before they share one.
The main flow speaks to the psyche only in its response. A proposal lives in the conversation, revised there, until the psyche approves a landing. A subflow lands it by reading the approval from the transcript; the main flow does not reprint approved content.
