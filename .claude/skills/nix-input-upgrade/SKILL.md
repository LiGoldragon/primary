description: 'A Nix flake input revision must change or be removed. Requires: nix-workflow.'
---

Map each dependency to its final provider before updating.
Push a producer before its consumer lock changes.
Verify a required fix by the commit that contains it.
For a named input update, update each naming-contract pin to preserve its owning contract, or remove it only when that contract is explicitly retired, and witness either outcome with its contract test.
For every local patch, remove it as upstream only when the selected final provider revision contains its change; otherwise state and verify the minimal migration-only or still-required patch action.
Remove an input only after confirming that it has no consumers and no naming-contract pins. Then prune only unreachable nodes from the lock graph.
Evaluate every consumer.
